# MMS_FirmwareFRQ
Firmware for the microcontroller of the FRQ module
  
This repository contains the firmware for the current as well as for the first version of the FRQ module of the Modular Measurement System.  
The current version enables up to two pins for frequency measurement. The frequency measurements are averaged from several consecutive readings.
The measured values are can be sent to the main controller of the MMS via the Serial 1 port.
  
The library required for the main controller to read the measurement values can be found [here](https://github.com/f-zach/MMS_FRQ/tree/master).
